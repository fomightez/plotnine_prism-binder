This repository is set up to demonstrate use of [the Plotnine Python package](https://plotnine.org/) using the Prism themes inspired by [ggprism][1].

Plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python based on R's `ggplot2`.  
The `ggprism` package provides various themes, palettes, and other useful functions to customise ggplots and give them the 'GraphPad Prism' look
